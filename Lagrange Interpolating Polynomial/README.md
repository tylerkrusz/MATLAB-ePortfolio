# Matlab-Lagrange-Interpolating-Polynomial
A MATLAB script that will take a vector of x points and a vector of y points and will print a polynomial that will intersect those points.

How to use?
Currently set to intersect the points (8, 2) and (2, -2) which looks like:
x = [8 10];
y = [2 -2];
And will produce a line with the equation y = ((2*(x-10))/-2)+((-2*(x-8))/2) = -2x+18
