# MATLAB-Newtons-Method
A MATLAB script that uses Newtons Method to approximate zeros of a function.

Example:
Where 75 - x^3 = 125 which can be rewritten as 75 - x^3 - 125 = 0 to be able to use newtons method.
Input:
f(x) = ((75*x) - x^3 - 125), the function to find the zero of
x_n = 2, this is the initial guess for Newtons Method
n = 1000, how many iterations, more will be more accurate
Output:
Lost Percision at n = 6
